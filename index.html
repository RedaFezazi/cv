<p><em>Future <strong>developer</strong></em></p>
<p>Jag bor i Sverige just nu, mais avant cela, je vivais a Paris,
    and before that I was in Algeria, the country where i was born and raised.
    I studied architecture for three long years and beside when we were doing 3d designs or geometry,
    I never felt like I belonged to that field.
    Now my biggest regret is that I didn't get into the world of coding,
    which I always felt connected to, a bit earlier.
    Funny story: my university registered me for my first year in the IT department by mistake,
    I still wonder what would have happened if I just went on with it. </p>
